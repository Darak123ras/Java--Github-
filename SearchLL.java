/*
 * Problem statement
You are given a Singly Linked List of integers with a head pointer. Every node of the Linked List has a value 
written on it.

A sample Linked List:
Now you have been given an integer value, 'K'. Your task is to check whether a node with a value equal to 'K' 
exists in the given linked list. Return 1 if node exists else return 0.
Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
3 6 2 7 9 -1
2
Sample Output 1:
1
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
As value 2 exists in the given linked list. So we will return 1 in this case.
Sample Input 2:
1 2 3 7 -1
7
Sample Output 2:
1
Explanation for Sample Input 2:
As the value 7 exists in the Linked List, our answer is 1.
Expected Time Complexity:
Try solving this in O(L).
Constraints:
1 <= 'L' <= 10^5
1 <= 'data' <= 10^9 and 'data' != -1
1 <= 'K' <= 10^9   
Where 'L' represents the total number of nodes in the Linked List, 'data' represents the value at each node, and 
'K' is the given integer.
Time Limit: 1 sec.
